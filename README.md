# Pomodoro Timer

A timer website created for studying using the pomodoro method.

# Key Features

## Timer

- The timer by default is set to 25 minutes, but can go as low as 5 minutes and as high as 60 minutes. Once started, the timer counts down from its set time to 0.

## Buttons

- The timer has 6 buttons: `Start`, `Pause`, `Resume`, `Reset`, `<` and `>`.

- The `Start` button once clicked, starts the timer. The `<` button decreases and the `>` button increases the timers amount by 5 mins each when clicked. Once the timer starts, these buttons are hidden so that the timer cannot be altered once it has started.

- The `Pause` and `Reset` buttons are revealed once the timer has started to allow the user to stop or reset the timer at any given point. Once the pause button has been clicked, it is replaced with the `Resume` button and the reset button remains unchanged. The resume button continues the timer from when it left off and the reset button sets the timer back to its default settings, allowing the user to edit the timers amount and start it again.
