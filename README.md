# Pomodoro Timer

A website that counts down and logs the amount of time/sets taken using the pomodoro method.

# Key Features

## Timer

- The timer by default is set to 25 minutes, but can go as low as 15 minutes and as high as 60 minutes. Once started, the timer counts down from its set time to 0.

## Buttons

- The timer has 3 buttons: `Start`, `<` and `>`. The start buton once clicked, starts the timer and the "<" ">" buttons are removed so that the timer cannot be altered once started. The two arrow buttons increase and decrease the amount of time by 5 minutes each. The "<" button decreases the timer by 5 minutes when clicked, and the ">" button increases the timer by 5 minutes when clicked.
